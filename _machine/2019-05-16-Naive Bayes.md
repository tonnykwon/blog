Naive Bayes Classifier is a classifier out of a probability model. Assume we already know the posterior probability, \(p(y|x)\). Now we will assign the class y for the data that has highest probability $$p(y|x)$$. And the issue here is how to find the probability $$p(y|x) $$.

Applying Bayes' theorem gives:

$$ p(y|x) = \frac{p(x|y) p(y)} {p(x)} $$
