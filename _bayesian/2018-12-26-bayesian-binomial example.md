In the last post, we talked about binomial example from bayesian perspective. We only considered using the uniform prior distribution for $$ \theta $$. It is reseaonable to use such non-informative prior when we do not have knowledge about the $$ \theta $$. <br/>
This post we consider other prior distribution for the coin tossing experiments. In the population inteerpretation, the prior expresses possible parameter values of $$ \theta $$.
