Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) is a general method of drawing samples from a target distribution with relatively faster speed to converge and its capability of simulating various distributions.

## Markov Chain

Before we go through MCMC, what is Markov Chain? Markov chain is a sequence of random variables $$\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_n$$.
